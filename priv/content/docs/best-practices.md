# Best practices

## Issue specs

Good issue specs are the recipe for success.

Explain in detail the desired outcome, any limitations and the acceptance criteria. Include references, examples and mockups where applicable.

- "It should abide by our code styles" is not a requirement and is extremely vague, has no clarity in communication
- "It should do X, while we don't want Y, we could ignore if it does Z, but definitely shouldn't do K" is the correct approach

Explain technical requirements to work on the issue, ex "Our project requires Mac, with at least this amount of RAM"

## PR review

- Require devs to demonstrate via screenshot/recording that at least X, Y, Z was accomplished to get PR review
- Close low quality AI PRs without review
- Do not assign developers without a contribution history
